            <ul>
                <li>
                    In my work, in addition to the tests that we have to do during the development of the systems, 
                    we pass all the code of the system in SonarQube, a product of Code Quality and Code Security.
                     One thing I've noticed is that when we develop we want to get to the end and we don't care too 
                     much about how to program. When we run the sonar, we notice the amount of bad programming, 
                     complicated ifs, code repetitions, etc... The Sonar program runs when we go into production.
                      If the errors presented are greater than 4%, we have to recode the errors presented.
