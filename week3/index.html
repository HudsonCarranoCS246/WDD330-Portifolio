                    When Javascript was created and included in Netscape Navigator 2.0 in 1995 I had the opportunity to study it. At the time I didn't think it would develop as much as it has in recent years. Being fully oriented, it becomes modern and efficient. With the
                    various methods and properties it becomes quite powerful. The use of this referencing the enveiroment, the junction with points to access the methods and properties becomes effective and efficient. Many frameworks like React, Vue or
                    Angular used in front-end.
