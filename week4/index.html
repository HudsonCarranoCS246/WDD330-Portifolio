                    When studying the form I remembered that it is essential to capture information for decision making. 
                    Therefore, I remembered that the data in the form are sometimes very interesting but are not useful 
                    for users to make decisions with them. When I worked in the area of epidemiology, the director of 
                    the area told the doctors who gave information to IT professionals that should capture important 
                    data and not attractive and curious. The job was to have information to take political measures 
                    to reduce the incidence of diseases. I was very grateful to remember these experiences as I studied.
