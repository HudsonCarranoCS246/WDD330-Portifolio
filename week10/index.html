                    I have developed systems in my work using the VUE framework. It is very easy to establish validation rules for the fields. I had already forgotten how to do it using direct JavaScript. Readings have been very interesting. The use of Fetch API in the systems I develop is the same way, but it's always good to remember. Due to the delivery time of the systems, we do many automatic things and copy what has already worked. When there is something different from the standard we use, we waste time and need to research what to do.                </li>
